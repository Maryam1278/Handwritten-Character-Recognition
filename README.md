Handwritten Character Recognition
Project Overview
This project develops a handwritten character recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It can be extended to recognize letters and entire words.

Key Features
CNN Architecture: Effectively captures spatial hierarchies in images for recognition.
Data Augmentation: Increases model robustness with real-time enhancements.
Early Stopping: Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation loss.
High Accuracy: Achieves competitive classification performance.
How to Run
Install Dependencies: Ensure all required libraries are installed.
Run the Script: Execute the provided code to train the model and visualize results.
Make Predictions: Use the predict_and_display function for testing.
Future Work
Extend Recognition: Add support for letters and phrases.
Improve Model: Test different architectures and tune hyperparameters.
Deployment: Implement real-time recognition.
